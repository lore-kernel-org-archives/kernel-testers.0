Patch for that does exits, but doesn't apply to latest git,
I will apply in manually.
This should go to .28 I think, this is trivial thing.

You can try "modprobe pciehp pciehp_force=1", maybe it helps the kernel discover the devices.  It worked for something else on my EeePC.  But then it will reportedly disappear the ethernet controller.

Got, a SD card, and with help of pciehp it works almost perfectly in both slots.
Almost, due to the fact that R/O switch is ignored.
(Just as I expected, a s/w switch, couldn't they think more, and include a hardware switch?)
On my main acer R/O switch works.

However I have to use pciehp_force=1, I understand that probably acpi tables are broken,
but could you add a workaround (dmi quirk?)

Also, there is a acpiphp driver, which doesn't work here.
pciehp is supposed to support so called native mode, don't yet know what it is,
but here it still uses acpi.

I almost sure why this happens, opengl application is out of textures,
I need to install gem enabled intel driver here, and see how it works.
