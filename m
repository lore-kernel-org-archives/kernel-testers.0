Hi,

Wow, what an extremely in-depth analysis!
I just intended to dive into getting mic routing corrected myself,
thus you saved me a lot of time!

+1 (your analysis of both being rather different - as already pondered -
confirms this necessity)

Sounds like really bad circuit design then.
One would think that the Intel HDA architecture might have builtin
measures to compensate for this if needed? DC offset issues on
soundcards aren't exactly a new phenomenon after all...

I've actually had a peek at the .inf files since I thought that it would
already contain register values in those registry keys that it creates on
install, but yeah, that's all in-driver it seems.
Probably time to ask Acer about specifics, especially since I didn't spot
any hda-intel changes in their linux-2.6.23.9lw source.

Thank you very much,
