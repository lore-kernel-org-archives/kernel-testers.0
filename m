I can't prove it for sure but the workload might not be targetted enough
to show better or worse read latencies.

I adjusted the workload to run fake-gitk multiple times to get a better
sense of the deviation between runs

On X86-64, the timings were

(I forgot to queue up the dm-crypt patches on their own for X86-64 which
is why the results are missing).

While the dm-crypt patch shows small differences, they are well within
the noise for each run of fake-gitk so I can't draw any major conclusion
from it.

On X86 for 2.6.31, roughly the same amount of time is spent in
congestion_wait() with or without the patch. On 2.6.32-rc6, the time
kswapd spends congestioned on the ASYNC queue is reduced by about 20%
both when compared against mainline and compared against the other
patches in the series applied. There is very little difference to the
congestion on the SYNC queue.

On X86-64 for 2.6.31, the story is slightly different. I don't think
it's an architecture thing because the X86-64 machine has twice as many
cores as the X86 test machine. Here, congestion_wait() spent on the
ASYNC queue remains roughly the same but the time spent on the SYNC
queue for direct reclaim is reduced by almost a third. Against
2.6.32-rc6, there was very little difference.

Again, it's hard to draw solid conclusions from this. I know from other
testing that the low_latency tunable for the IO scheduler is an important
factor for the performance of this test on 2.6.32-rc6 so if disabled, it
mgiht show a clearer picture, but right now I can't say for sure it's an
improvement.
