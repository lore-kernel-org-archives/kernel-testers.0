Wow, nice analysis!
I had already intended to report that you're #2 who told me that Mic does work
(and I was starting to feel weird since I'm the only one who cannot
get it to work!)
Given your analysis, things start to make a lot more sense now.

That probably means that Ekiga Wizard uses mono input (since it does not work
for me), whereas many other apps use stereo input as (natively!) supported
by this hardware setup?

--> alsa lib bug sounds like a good guess.

Thanks,

Andreas Mohr
