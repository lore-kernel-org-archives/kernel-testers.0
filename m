I had the same thoughts later. Since they use an extensive SAM handling
library, there probably isn't such a chip, otherwise they probably
wouldn't need it ;)
Could you thus implement a nice beam-forming sound evaluation SAM
library for ALSA pretty pretty please? ;)
...or, is that SAM library available to us given that it exists in the
factory install? If so, then one should probably make good use of it...

I'm not *quite* sure whether this is really what you meant,
but I patched /usr/share/alsa/cards/HDA-Intel.conf (libasound2
1.0.18-1ubuntu7) in exactly this way and then did
arecord -Dplughw:0 -fdat -c1 test.wav; aplay test.wav
but well, with equal slider positions there was no audio again.
