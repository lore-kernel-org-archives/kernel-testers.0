Hmm, right, that would have been an (very useful) option, but not for the
majority of users OTOH.
Especially since this is a user-visible module parameter which should thus
be confirmed in mainstream user code, via logging.
Admittedly not many modules log their settings during startup,
but for snd_hda_intel with its two myriads of codec/machine variants
and a resulting quarter myriad of issues that would be very useful.

See above ;)

Good point, will do.

Oh, and is there a way to manually alter codec registers?

Indeed, and far too late (they have submitted it in September I think)
for guaranteeing non-problematic hardware behaviour...
(I'd guesstimate the Realtek submission to be based on Acer activity)
Anyway, still very nice to see that companies do submit patches after all.

Thanks,
