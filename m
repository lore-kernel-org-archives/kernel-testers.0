Yes, Capture Volume does influence i-Mic level.
The Digital Capture control, however, doesn't influence level.
As doesn't the Mic Boost Capture control (probably about e-Mic only?).

Oh, you mean "inverted" as in "_hardware_ channel which provides opposi=
te
sample values as compared to the other channel"?

That exactly matches my current stream of thought (while reading
"one channel is inverted" above).

That's something specific to ALC268 codec setup, right?
("ALC268 digital mic =3D=3D left plus right channel, but inverted setup=
"?)

OK, I know what you're up to, I'll do this external proof ASAP,
will take a couple more minutes.
